              It is a misconception that those with type 1 diabetes cannot or
              should not have children [see Section "Type 1 Diabetes: Myth
              Busters"]. However, a healthy and safe pregnancy with diabetes
              requires a lot of work. Here are important things you should know:
              {"\n"} - Pregnancy should be planned to avoid complications.
              {"\n"} - Use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant.
              {"\n"} - If you are planning pregnancy, it is best if your HbA1C
              is in target before falling pregnant; this refers to a target of
              7% or less, or 6.5% or less if possible.
              {"\n"} - The key to a healthy pregnancy for a woman with diabetes
              is keeping blood glucose levels in the target rangeâ€”both before
              and during pregnancy.
              {"\n"} - Poorly controlled diabetes in a pregnant woman with type
              1 diabetes increases the risk of miscarriage, having a baby born
              with a malformation and having a stillborn.

              Women with type 1 diabetes should discuss pregnancy plans with
              their diabetes health-care team to:
              {"\n"} - Review blood glucose targets.
              {"\n"} - Assess general health and status of any diabetes-related
              complications.
              {"\n"} - Aim for optimal weight and, if overweight, start weight
              loss before pregnancy with healthy eating.
              {"\n"} - Review medications.
              {"\n"} - Start folic acid supplementation (1.0 mg daily).
              {"\n"} - Ensure appropriate vaccinations have occurred.

              If you ever find out you are pregnant, contact your diabetes team
              as soon as possible so specialized prenatal care can be arranged
              immediately.
