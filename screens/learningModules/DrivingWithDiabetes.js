              To ensure safe driving, there are important aspects of your
              diabetes care you need to be aware of before getting in a car. The
              major concern is low blood sugar, as having a low blood sugar
              while driving is considered "impaired driving."

              To avoid this:
              {"\n"} - Measure your blood glucose level before driving: it
              should be around 5 mmol/L, i.e. “5 to drive”
              {"\n"} - Do not start driving if your blood glucose level is less
              than 4 mmol/L.
              {"\n"} - If your blood glucose is less than 4 mmol/L, do not start
              driving until you have ingested 15 grams of carbohydrate, you have
              retested and your blood glucose is at least 5 mmol/L. Wait for 40
              minutes as it takes time for judgment and reflexes to the brain to
              recover fully from hypoglycemia.
              {"\n"} - Always keep an emergency supply of fast-acting
              carbohydrate, such as dextrose tablets, within easy reach inside
              the vehicle
              {"\n"} - Carry your glucose meter and supplies.
              {"\n"} - If you go on a long drive, measure your blood glucose at
              least every 4 hours while driving. You can also wear a real-time
              continuous blood glucose monitoring device.
              {"\n"} - Consider measuring your blood glucose more frequently if
              there are factors that may increase your risk of hypoglycemia,
              such as recent physical activity or a delay in eating or skipping
              a meal.
              {"\n"} - If hypoglycemia develops while driving, stop the vehicle
              in a safe location and remove the keys from the ignition. Treat
              the low blood glucose and wait 40 minutes before driving.
              {"\n"} - On longer journeys, take regular meals, snacks and
              periods of rest.
